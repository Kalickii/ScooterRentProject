# ScooterRentProject

**Project Idea**  
    A Scooter Rental platform allowing customers to browse available scooters, view details for each model and
    make scooter reservations with a deposit.

**Problem it Solves**  
    Provides customers with easy, self-service access to scooter rentals,
    automating processes and reducing the need for phone inquiries,
    thus enhancing professionalism and efficiency for the company.

 **Detailed Concept**  
    The website will allow potential customers to access a catalog of available scooters with photos.
    Each scooter details will display rental prices (daily, weekly, monthly),
    and a deposit amount. Users will have the option to reserve scooters,
    which involves selecting dates, and paying a deposit.
    Reservations will only be available to logged-in users;
    non-logged-in users will be redirected to create an account or log in upon clicking "Book" button.
